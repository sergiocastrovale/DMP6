# Ideas and future features

## Listening Party

- Make it session based (e.g. discodomeuprimo.online would accept a session ID before ALL routes like /283nf91nd10/browse)

- /party-debug should become the main page for listers (e.g. /party when PARTY_ROLE=listener). Clicking on the "Live" icon in the player should lead there

##  Scrobbler / last.fm integration

- Scrobbler / last.fm integration config in settings page

- Integrate in player

## Settings

- Allow setting up paths via DB (directly modify .env?)

- Allow invoking scripts via Settings?
