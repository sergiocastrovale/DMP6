# TO DO

## Bug fixes

- Fix UI issues in the current features

- Improve player UI

- Fix play/pause bug (it's not autoplaying)

## Web core

1. Advanced filters could be merged with the explore page where we're listing per decade etc. but now with mood/intensity and other things

2. Varied ways of exploring the catalogue and discovering music (fully random, per genre, per decade, per mood/intensity)

## Slsk integration

* Bundle the config and write docs about all necessary steps

* Use V5 script that will trigger slsk and download things (no web UI for now)

* See if Beets gets invoked automatically upon download

## Beets integration

* Bundle the config and write docs about all necessary steps

* Create a Node script that will trigger beets for new things on the catalogue (?)

* Make sure we can re-sync properly and automatically

## Other web features

* Audioscrobbler / last.fm integration

* Fuzzy genre playlists (auto-generates playlist with several similar genres - UI could have a slider in which we'd raise and lower genres pills visually)

* Statistics

* Playlists

* Proximity map

* Reporting

Take inspiration from SongKong and build all sorts of advanced reporting about

1. Release dates

2. Release country

3. Genres, mood/intensity, bpm

4. Missing important metatags

5. Missing connection with MB, Discogs, Bandcamp

## Dataviz?

An area for exploration with visually mindblowing experiences.

1. Proximity map

2. World map
